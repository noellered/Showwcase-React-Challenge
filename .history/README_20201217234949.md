# Showwcase Developer Challenge

## Goal

Your challenge is to create a simple web app in the technology you are applying to work in. Your task is to simulate how a user will be able to input their educational background into their Showwcase profile page. 

You should not just implement the most basic solution. This is a chance to show off your abilities, creativity, and impress.

## Requirements

- We use the create-react-app typescript template, you can find instructions here:
[https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
- Users must be able to enter as many educational experiences as they please;
- When the user is typing the name of the school they went, it should be auto completed using an API call.
- Users must be able to enter the following information: Name of School, Degree, Field of study, Start year, End Year (Or expected), Grade, a Description field, and anything else you wish to add.

## Methods and Technologies
- TypeScript
- [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
- [Hipo University List API](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api)
- Material UI (and material-ui's JSS solution)
- React-Window (for list virtualization, via MUI)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Future Feature Ideas
Overall:


Main Page:
- Implement Redux and/or backed to manage data and state more efficiently

Sidebar Component:
- Make each item clickable to activate education modal with pre-filled values
- Move "add education" to bottom of list
